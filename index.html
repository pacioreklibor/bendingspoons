            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                I live in a small town called Hlavnice near Opava in the Czech Republic. With my loving and lovely wife
                we have two
                children a 5 year old son and a 4 month old girl.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of work, I mostly hang out with my family.
                If time permits, I enjoy going cycling, going for a workout, or going to the sauna.
                I occasionally enjoy going out for a drink with friends.
            </p>
            <p>
                We love to travel a lot and enjoy it, often visiting the mountains in Czech Republic. We particularly
                enjoy the Mediterranean climate, culture, and cuisine. I am fascinated by the United States, which I
                have visited twice.

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                I was delighted when I came across the job advertisement for a Software Engineer at Bending Spoons on
                LinkedIn. <br>
                After reading your article, I became interested in your company, which I honestly had not heard of.
                But actually, I've heard a lot about your products like Evernote and Meetup, which makes me even more
                interested.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like what you believe in and what you want to achieve, we have similar goals.
                I am deeply concerned about the standard of the product that I am engaged in.
                The customer and every detail that can affect the comfort of using the product are important to me.
                I am not comfortable standing in the background, I try to get involved in the discussion.
                I am not solely interested in obtaining a salary and occupying a position, but rather in fostering and
                enhancing my skills, building a robust product that customers can rely on, and they like, and exchanging
                ideas and knowledge.
                Furthermore, I strive to achieve perfection in every aspect of my work, and of course, I accept personal
                accountability for my actions.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the job description, you are looking for a person who can think logically and critically, who can
                accept the opinions of others,
                a person who wants to push things further.
                I worked as a technical support engineer for most of my professional career, but I have always been
                interested in software development.
                I have previously developed several Python or PowerShell scripts; however, I cannot claim to be an
                expert in these scripting languages.
                I believe that, even though I do not have a lot of experience as a software engineer, I could be the
                person you are looking for.

                <h3>September 2020 – Present Vendavo, Ostrava (Czech Republic)</h3>
                <h4>Technical Support Engineer -> Supervisor</h4>
                <p>
                    Vendavo is a leading company in pricing and selling solutions for businesses. The project referred
                    to as
                    VPP (Vendavo Pricepoint), which involves cloud-based commercial excellence solutions, was acquired
                    by
                    Vendavo through the acquisition of Nevetti. Working on tickets created by clients was the main
                    objective, aiming for the quickest possible resolution. This entails, for instance, utilizing the
                    MSSQL
                    database, which houses the backend of the application. There was, of course, constant interaction
                    with
                    other teams, such as Cloud Operations and Engineering, or Technical Engagement Managers and Customer
                    Success Managers. In May 2022, I was promoted to a senior role.
                    I became a Lead Technical Support Engineer in October 2022. This entailed the replacement of the
                    manager
                    during his absence, focusing on sensitive cases, providing mentoring, and enhancing the process.
                    In September 2024, I became a supervisor for technical support. The main task of this position is to
                    supervise the daily operations of two teams of 14 people.
                </p>
                <h4>Responsibilities:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Analyzing software issues and requirements, daily communication with the customers from all over
                        the
                        world
                    </li>

                    <li>Automating server tasks using PowerShell, Python</li>
                    <li>Creating own tools with Python, such as monitoring and analysis</li>
                    <li>Monitoring hosted applications using Monitoring Alerts, Grafana, Log4net, and custom monitoring
                        tools
                    </li>
                    <li>Creating documentation for internal and external purposes. Additionally, as Senior/Lead DevOps
                        Engineer
                    </li>
                    <li>Helping the team manager to manage the team</li>
                    <li>Management of crisis</li>

                    <li>Mentoring</li>
                    <li>Supervising daily operations</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Over the past four years, our team has stabilized the product by gaining great product knowledge and
                    awesome troubleshooting skills. New practices are brought in as standard, and we provide expertise
                    to
                    other teams.
                    I would venture to say that I had a significant contribution to the accomplishments, but we achieved
                    them collectively as a team.

                <h3>Oct 2018 – Aug 2020 Alfun, Bruntal (Czech Republic)</h3>
                <h4>IT Specialist</h4>
                <p>
                    A company that makes aluminum, steel, and stainless-steel sheets, strips, plates, bars, and
                    profiles. My
                    primary objective was to effectively oversee the transition from an outdated CRM to the new one. We
                    decided to use IFS products. The main focus was to provide and manage an on-premises environment and
                    data migration from Microsoft SQL to Oracle Database. I have created my own ETL scripts, written in
                    Python.
                </p>
                <h4>Responsibilities:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Integration of CRM system IFS</li>
                    <li>Moderating communication between the company and the software supplier.</li>
                    <li>Creating Crystal Reports (SAP), IFS Business Analytics using PL/SQL</li>
                    <li>Data migration using SQL, ETL in Python</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The project turned out to be exceedingly challenging owing to the specialized industry. The CRM
                    system
                    required numerous customizations and new logic to be implemented. The transition to the new system
                    has
                    been many times almost canceled. But just before I left the company, the project went live and has
                    been
                    used in production.
