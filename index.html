            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                I live in a small town called Hlavnice near Opava in the Czech Republic. My three children are a 12 year
                old daughter, a 5 year old son and a 4 month old girl. Outside of work, I mostly hang out with my
                family. If time permits, I enjoy going cycling, going for a workout, or going to the sauna. As someone
                who enjoys socializing, I occasionally enjoy going out for a drink with friends.
                We love to travel a lot and enjoy it, often visiting the mountains in Czech Republic. We particularly
                enjoy the Mediterranean climate, culture, and cuisine. I am fascinated by the United States, which I
                have visited twice.

                    automation, CRM systems, finance, and development. My knowledge and learning opportunities in broad
                    wide technologies were provided by project diversity and specificity.

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                I was delighted when I came across the job advertisement for a Software Engineer at Bending Spoons on
                LinkedIn. </br>
                After reading your article, I became interested in your company, which I honestly had not heard of.
                But actually, I've heard a lot about your products like Evernote and Meetup, which makes me even more
                interested.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like what you believe in and what you want to achieve, we have similar goals.
                I am deeply concerned about the standard of the product that I am engaged in.
                The customer and every detail that can affect the comfort of using the product are important to me.
                I am not comfortable standing in the background, I try to get involved in the discussion.
                I am not solely interested in obtaining a salary and occupying a position, but rather in fostering and
                enhancing my skills, building a robust product that customers can rely on, and they like, and exchanging
                ideas and knowledge.
                Furthermore, I strive to achieve perfection in every aspect of my work, and of course, I accept personal
                accountability for my actions.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the job description, you are looking for a person who can think logically and critically, who can
                accept the opinions of others,
                a person who wants to push things further.
                I worked as a technical support engineer for most of my professional career, but I have always been
                interested in software development.
                I have previously developed several Python or PowerShell scripts; however, I cannot claim to be an
                expert in these scripting languages.
                I believe that, even though I do not have a lot of experience as a software engineer, I could be the
                person you are looking for.

                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
                typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
                survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
                It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
                Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
                more recently with desktop publishing software like
                Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
